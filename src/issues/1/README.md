It’s Friday again – time for your weekly React Core and React DOM insights. Before we start I’d like to thank you for subscribing to the newsletter ❤️. You can support me by sharing the link to the website ([https://this-week-in-react.org](https://this-week-in-react.org)) and by being patient while I figure out the final format of this 🙂.

🚀 The biggest shoutout this week goes to Alexander Nanberg ([@alexnanberg](https://twitter.com/alexnanberg)) for working tirelessly on moving reactjs.org to [@gatsbyjs](https://twitter.com/gatsbyjs) v2 - Great to see it online 🙌 https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/pull/1104

⚡️ Brian ([@brian_d_vaughn](https://twitter.com/brian_d_vaughn)) worked on a deep-dive video on how to use the new React Profiler. You should definitely check it out if you haven’t already! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySib7ipZdk

🎉 Jérôme Steunou ([JSteunou](https://github.com/JSteunou)) and Joel Barbosa ([joelbarbosa](https://github.com/joelbarbosa)) landed their first patch in the newly released React 16.5.2 - a minor stability release. https://github.com/facebook/react/releases/tag/v16.5.2

💡 Artemy Tregubenko ([arty-name](https://github.com/arty-name)) filed a new RFC to allow React.Children.toArray() to treat `<Fragment>`s as transparent containers so they would be ignored in the array and their children would be used instead. Definitely an interesting use case - Feedback welcome! https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/61

🐢 The React team now owns the "scheduler" npm package. Dan (@dan_abramov) already ported over the React Scheduler - A package for cooperative scheduling in a browser environment and is used to implement concurrent mode in React. https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/13683

---

🔎 Brian ([@brian_d_vaughn](https://twitter.com/brian_d_vaughn)) also worked on a new name for the experimental Tracing API (previously known as tracking). It’s used trace the _cause_ of an update. I welcome the new name and think it’s a great way to avoid confusion. https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/09/10/introducing-the-react-profiler.html#interactions https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/13641

🕵️‍ A mysterious React 16.6.0-alpha was released on npm this week - Right when everyone is starting to get curious about what’ll be released at next month’s React Conf. I was not able to figure out what’s new, but maybe you can? https://www.npmjs.com/package/react/v/16.6.0-alpha.0

👏 Special thank you to our first time contributors who got their work merged this week: Maksim Markelov ([mmarkelov](https://github.com/mmarkelov)) and Sam Kvale ([skvale](https://github.com/skvale)).

And of course to everyone else who’s working on making React better - You’re awesome!
